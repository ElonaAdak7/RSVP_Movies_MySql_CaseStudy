The task is to extract valuable insights from the data, offering guidance to help them kickstart their international project.
## Analytical Appraoch :
Utilized SQL for the examination of the provided dataset and provided recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the derived insights. To enhance convenience, the entire analytical process has been partitioned into four segments, with each segment yielding substantial insights from distinct combinations of tables. The SQL script includes questions in each segment, aligning with specific business objectives, and the solution code is provided below each question.
## Data Set Overview
The dataset given in the file section and follow the given steps to insert all the values for the entire schema. 
### Note: It is highly recommended to create the SQL database on your local machine using the dataset. However, note that this part is completely optional if you wish, you can directly run the SQL script given in the file section.
# Steps to follow:
- 1. Download the IMDb dataset from above.
- 2. The first tab contains the ERD and the table details. Study that carefully and understand the relationships between the table.
- 3. Inspect each table given in the subsequent tabs and understand the features associated with each of them.
- 4. Open your MySQL Workbench and start writing the DDL and DML commands to create the database.
 If don't wish to perform the data loading part, can directly download the SQL script file given in the add file section containing all the commands and data required for the database creation and start directly with the querying and in this file (IMDb Dataset Import) data loading part has been given .
# SQL Queries:
## SQL Script File:
The question SQL script file given with the final codes (answers) written in it. 
## Executive Summary: 
The executive summary file consisting of the important insights derived from the data and some recommendations to be given to RSVP movies for their project and it is uploaded in the pdf file .
